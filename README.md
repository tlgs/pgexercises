Solutions to the problems over at [PostgreSQL Exercises](https://pgexercises.com/).

The [PostgreSQL Official Documentation](https://www.postgresql.org/docs/)
is your best friend while solving these.

## Style

Style is important when it comes to writing SQL,
and the solutions proposed by the author don't set the best standard.

This project tries to be consistent with the
[Mozilla SQL Style Guide](https://docs.telemetry.mozilla.org/concepts/sql_style.html).
Additionally, [SQLFluff](https://www.sqlfluff.com/) is used as a linter.
